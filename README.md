## Introduction 


## Method 

### Initial setup of each RP
There is quite a lot of setup needef or each machine. In this section we will discuss what needs to be done on each and every RP machine to set it up. In short it is the following: 

- [ ] Get an operating system to the SD memory card - We used Rasbian
- [ ] Change the keyboard layout of the OS
- [ ] Change the name of the RP
- [ ] Connect each RP to internet so that we can...
- [ ] ... dowload docker to each RP

##### Get an operating system to the SD memory card
There are various [OS that can be setup on a Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/), we chose to use Rasbian. Rasbian is a version of the [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian) which is a Unix-like operating system. We also choose to use the version of Rasbian without a desktop, that is Rasbian Stretch Lite. 

The steps to get the OS to the SD cards are the following: 
* Download [Ether](https://etcher.io/) 
* Download the [Raspbian Stretch Lite image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
* Unzip the Rasbian Strech Lite image. 
* Open Ether and insert an SD card to your own computer
* In Ether, choose the .img image file for the OS, the SD card, and then click **Flash!**

##### Change the keyboard layout of the OS
##### Change the name of the RP
#### Connect each RP to internet
#### Dowload docker to each RP
